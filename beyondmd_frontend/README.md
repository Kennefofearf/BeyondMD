# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `File Structure`

Front-end files are located under: hello_beyondmd/beyondmd_frontend
Back-end files are located under: hello_beyondmd/hello_beyondmd

### `Docker`

Front and back-end folders will each contain a dockerfile for building an image.
The docker-compose.yml at the top level expects the names "front-end" and "back-end" for each image respectively.

Once both images have been created run the command for the docker-compose at the top level to bring the site live locally.
